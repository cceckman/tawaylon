    // it will block until the server has received and processed all the messages you've
    // sent up to now.

    // wl_display.get_registry request, and as a reaction has sent us a batch of
    // wl_registry.global events.

    // `roundtrip` will then empty the internal buffer of the queue it has been invoked
    // on, and thus invoke our `Dispatch` implementation that prints the list of advertised
    // globals.

    // Roundtrip sends a Sync request to the compositor; that's why it Works!
